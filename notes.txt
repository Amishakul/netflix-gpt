just like parcel, create-react-app uses web pack as a bundler.

For big forms use Formik library

1. useref -> suppose if you want to find what is there inside the input box, so i need a reference to that input box and that reference is created by react using useref hook.

2. const email = useRef(null);
const password = useRef(null); -> these are references, it will create a reference.
And now refer this above reference i.e. const email = useRef(null);
const password = useRef(null); to the input boxes of email and password.

3. ref={email} and ref={password} -> is the reference to this input boxes

4. email.current.value -> gives value of input box email.

5. In easy way, useRef email and password will let me know what is there inside the textbox of email and password.

6. Instead of using useref we can also use, usestate hook

7. email.current -> refering to input box
email.current.value -> value present in the input box

8. useRef is used to reference a field in the code. (textbox)



Build folder is used to deploy the project in firebase

if message is there i.e. some error is there in the credentials, in this case return null i.e. if(message) return; 

OR

if message is not there i.e. No errors are there in the credentials, in this case perform sign in/ sign up authentication

if(!message) {
    sign in/sign up authentication perform 
}


OnAuthStateChange Api -> is called, whenever the user sign in, sign up, sign out i.e. whenever there is authentication state change.
